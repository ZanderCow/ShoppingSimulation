# ShoppingSimulation
- This is a program that simulates a shopping list. While I didn't write most the code myself, I did, however, write the testing classes. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency and Jay unit testing and testing test cases. 

# To run this program 
- I highly suggest that you use NetBeans, because that was the IDE I used for building program. There is a very small chance that if you use a different IDE things could go wrong so go at your own risk.
